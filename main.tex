%	OVERVIEW
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\begin{alertblock}{Overview}

%We present a database of emotional speech intended to be open-sourced and used for synthesis and generation purpose. It contains data for male and female actors in English and a male actor in French. The database covers 5 emotion classes so it could be suitable to build synthesis and voice transformation systems with the potential to control the emotional dimension in a continuous way.\\
%We then present three experiments (emotional voice conversion, categorical emotional TTS, and control of emotional intensity in TTS)  and their results.


\begin{itemize}
    \item Dataset for hexaphonic guitar practice (i.e with a individual set of effects for each string) analysis as well as MIR-related tasks
    
    \item Contains synchronized video, audio, data and transcribed interview for each improvisation recording
    
    \item Annotated data include : picth, fret, playing techniques, extended playing techniques, improvisation structure, tuning, audio effects and presets

    \item Each sub-scenario was divided in three sections : test, improvisation recording and interview. These three steps could be repeated as often as wished

\begin{block}{Recording setup}


%This system is built by extracting speech features with the WORLD vocoder of both source and target emotional voices, performing a Dynamic Time Warping  to align the features in time and computing a regression between the source and target features. The regression model used is a simple deep neural network (DNN) of 6 feedforward hidden layers in which each hidden layer is constituted of 1024 hyperbolic tangent units.

%\caption{Experimental audio and recording setup.}
%\label{demo}
%\end{figure}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Medium long shot of the guitarist as well as hexaphonic multieffect GUI modifications were video recorded
    \item Audio recordings contain "dry" (i.e. no effect) and "wet" (i.e. with effects) hexaphonic signals as well as monophonic reduction of the wet signals
    \item Hexaphonic multieffect gathers 6 (arguably) "classic" audio effects for guitarists (distorsion, delay, ring modulator, flanger, tremolo and reverb) and a matrix representation of the individual bypasses
\end{itemize}

%we choose DCTTS, a system that seems to combine advantages of several systems. DCTTS models a sequence-to-sequence problem with a encoder-decoder structure along with an Attention Mechanism. Its architecture is entirely CNN-based, there is no RNN component.
%We investigate the possibility to adapt this model to have an emotional TTS. To do this, we fine-tune system to the neutral voice of one of the actresses of in our database. We then fine-tune the obtained neutral TTS model with each emotion class of the same speaker.
%The experiments performed on this dataset also assess its usability with deep learning algorithms for voice generation systems.

%Use of DCTTS (tensorflow implementation)
\begin{itemize}
    \item 5 guitarists, 3 days of experiment for each one
    \item 10h of musical improvisations and 4h30 of interviews
    \item Automatic (effects bypass activation), semi-automatic (pitch and fret), manual  (playing techniques and extended playing techniques) and global (tuning, improvisation structure, used effects and presets) annotations
    \item Annotations are in different formats in order to be imported in different kind of software (Sonic Visualizer\footnote{https://www.sonicvisualiser.org/}, Advene\footnote{https://www.advene.org/}, etc.)
    \item All the interviews have been transcribed in Microsoft Word format

\begin{block}{Analysis}
\begin{itemize}
    \item First analysis based on the transcriptions of the interviews
    \item All guitarists felt, at some point, constrained by the experimental setup (because of scenarios or technical elements) 
    \item All guitarists developed strategies to absorb the hexaphonic multieffect possibilities
    \item Despite being more "complex" to handle, the system respects the practice of the guitarist and is felt as "familiar" 
    %\begin{quote}
     %It doesn't question the practice. The practice stays, it exists. However, it reconsiders it, in the sense where, as new things happen, you have to adapt. [...] It's a system that forces you to look deeply at the instrument for ways to adapt, even if it is a material that I know. (Guitarist 2, extract of post improvisation interview, scenario2\_5, pers. comm.)
    %\end{quote}
    \item This system brings extensive sound possibilities similar to the ones found in digital audio software
    \item Hexaphonic multieffect could more easily fit into practices that use extensively individualisation of the fingers/strings, such as classical guitar or prepared guitar practices
%\begin{quote}
%With a classical guitar, we work with the aim of being able to have an action as independent as possible from each finger and therefore potentially also differentiated regarding the strings. (Guitarist 4, complementary interview, pers. comm.)
%\end{quote}
\end{itemize}

%multi-emotional TTS system with the possibility to control the intensity of emotional categories. We implemented a modified version of DCTTS that takes an encoding of the emotion category at the input of the decoder. During training, a simple one-hot encoding is used. But at synthesis stage, we can modify the intensity of an emotion category by inputting numbers smaller or greater than one. 
%The results sound encouraging and we are planning to do some subjective evaluations to assess the system.

\begin{itemize}
    \item More guitarists with different playing styles
    \item Tailored vizualization software development
    \item Use of theoretical music models (such as Anthony de Souza's fretboard transformations model\footnote{J. De Souza, “Fretboard Transformations,” Journal of
Music theory, vol. 62, no. 1, pp. 1–39, 2018.}) to have common ground for the analysis
